[Line surveys, instrument functions, rescale, crops... ]((https://radis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/spectrum/spectrum.html)). [Combine spectra](https://radis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/los/los.html) to create mixtures or calculate line-of-sight integrations.
[Compare with experiments](https://radis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/spectrum/spectrum.html#compare-two-spectra) or spectra from other codes like [Specair (UV/VIS)](https://spectralfit.gitlab.io/specair/), and let Radis handle units and interpolations.
